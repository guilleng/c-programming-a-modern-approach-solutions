# Chapter 03 - Project 05

Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any order) and then it displays the numbers in a 4 by 3 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows, coumns, and diagonals:

```
Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

16  3  2 13
 5 10 11  8
 9  6  7 12
 4 15 14  1

Row sums: 34 34 34 34
Column sums: 34 34 34 34
Diagonal sums: 34 34
```

If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this example), the numbers are said to form a magic square. The magic square shown here appears in a 1514 engraving by artist an mathematician Albrecht Durer. (Note that the middle numbers in the last row give the date of the engraving.)
