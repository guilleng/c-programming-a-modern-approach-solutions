# Chapter 06 - Exercise 11

What does the output of the following program fragment produce?

```
sum = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2)
        continue;
    sum += i;
}
printf("%d\n", sum);
```

---

The loop is evaluated 10 times. For each evaluation where `i` is set to an even value, its value is added with `sum` and stored into  `sum`. For iterations in which `i` is odd, the `continue` statement gets evaluated and program control jumps to the update expression of the `loop`, leaving `sum` unchanged.  

Output: `20`
