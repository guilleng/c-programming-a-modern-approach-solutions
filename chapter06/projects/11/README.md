# Chapter 06 - Project 11

The value of the mathematical constant _e_ can be expressed as an infinite series:

```
e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...
```

Write a program that approximates _e_ by computing the value of

```
1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!
```

where `n` is an integer entered by the user.
