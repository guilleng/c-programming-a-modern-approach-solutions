# Chapter 02, Project 05

Write a program that ask the user to enter a value for x and then displays the value of the following polynomial:  

3x^5 + 2x^4 - 5x^3 - x^2 +7x - 6  

_Hint_: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply x by itself repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x.
