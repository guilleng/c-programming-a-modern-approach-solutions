---

The file `dweight.c` is a transcription of the program as written in section 2.4.  

+ The end of line at the `include` directive is essential for program compilation.  
+ The space between `int` and `main`.   
+ The space between `int` and the variables declarations.
+ The space between `return` and `0`.

The file `dweight-no-spaces.c` contains only the essential spaces.
