# Chapter 02, Exercise 04

Write a program that declares several `int` and `float` variables--without initializing them--and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values?  

Integers are all over the place, but floating point variables are all zero.  

Below is the resulting output of compiling and running `ex04.c`:  
```
non-initialized integers:
-1839202208
22032
-1732079280
non-initialized floats:
0.000000
0.000000
0.000000
```
