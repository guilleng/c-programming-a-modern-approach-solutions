# Chapter 15 - Project 03

Modify the `qsort.c` program of Section 9.6 by having the `quicksort` and `split` function are in a separate file named `quicksort.c`. Create a header file named `quicksort.h` that contains prototypes for the two functions and have both `qsort.c` and `quicksort.c` include this file.
