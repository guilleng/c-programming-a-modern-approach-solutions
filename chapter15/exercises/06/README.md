(a) 
Which files need to be compiled when the program is built for the first time?  

(b) 
If `f1.c` is changed after the program has been built, which files need to be recompiled?  

(c) 
If `f1.h` is changed after the program has been built, which files need to be recompiled?  

(d) 
If `f2.h` is changed after the program has been built, which files need to be recompiled?  

---

(a) 
All source files need to be compiled when the program is built for the first time.  

(b)
Only `f1.c`.  

(c)
The three source files need to be recompiled if `f1.h` is changed after the program has been built.  

(d)
`f1.c` and `f2.c` have to be recompiled.
