# Chapter 02 - Exercise 04

Write a program that declares several `int` and `float` variables--without initializing them--and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values?  

---

Integers are all over the place. Floating point variables are all zero.  

Below an output of compiling and running `ex04.c`:  

```
non-initialized integers:
-1839202208
22032
-1732079280
non-initialized floats:
0.000000
0.000000
0.000000
```
