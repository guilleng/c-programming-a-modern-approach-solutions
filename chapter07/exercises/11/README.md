# Chapter 07 - Exercise 11

Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type `float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double`. What is the type of the expression `i * f / d`?  

---

The product between `i` and `f` converts `i` to `float` but the quotient with `d` forces the expression to be of type `double`.
