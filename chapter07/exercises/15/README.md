# Chapter 07 - Exercise 15

Use `typedef` to create types names `Int8`, `Int16`, and `Int32`.  Define the
types so that they represent 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit integers on your machine.

---

`sizeof(char)` is `1 byte = 8 bits`

```C
typedef char Int8;`
```

`sizeof(short)` is `2 bytes = 16 bits`

```C
typedef short Int16;`
```

`sizeof(int)` is `4 bytes = 32 bits`

```C
typedef int Int32;` 
```
