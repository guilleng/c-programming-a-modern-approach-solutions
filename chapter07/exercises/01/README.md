(a) `077`
(b) `0x77`
(c) `0XABC`

(a)
__Octal__ constants begin with a `0` and contain only digits between `0` and `7`.

```
7 * 8^1 + 7 * 8^0 
  56     +   7  
	   63
```

(b) 
__Hexadecimal__ constants begin with `0x`. They contain only digits between `0` and `9` and letters between `a` and `f`.  

```
7 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0
  112    +    7
        119
```

(c)

```
 A * 16^2 +  B * 16^1 +  C * 16^0
10 * 16^2 + 11 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0
  2560    +   176     +    12
             2748
