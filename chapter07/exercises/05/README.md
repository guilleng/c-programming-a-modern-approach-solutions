# Chapter 07 - Exercise 05

Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number `65`? (Assume that the character set is ASCII.)

(a) `'A'`  
(b) `0b1000001`  
(c) `0101`  
(d) `0x41`  

---


(b) is not a legal way to write the number 65. The string appears to be a binary representation of the number, which is not a standard feature of the C language.
