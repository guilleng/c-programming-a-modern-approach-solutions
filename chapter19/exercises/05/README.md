# Chapter 19 - Exercise 05

Modify the `queue.h` header of Exercise 1 so that it defines a `Queue` type,
where `Queue` is a structure containing a fixed-length array (see Exercise
3(a)).  Modify the functions in `queue.h` to take a `Queue *` parameter.


---

The proposed interface in Exercise 3 defined a type named `queue_struct`
containing a fixed-length array.

See `../03/queue.h` and `../03/a-array-based/queue-array.c`.
