# Chapter 23 - Exercise 07 

Section 23.6 explains how to call `strchr` repeatedly to locate all occurrences
of a character within a string.  Is it possible to locate all occurrences in
reverse order by calling `strrchr` repeatedly?


---

Without modifying the string or storing a modified copy, it is not possible to
locate all occurrences of a character in a string in reverse order by repeatedly
calling `strrchr` alone.
