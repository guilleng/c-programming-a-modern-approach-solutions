# Chapter 23 - Project 01

Write a program that finds the roots of the equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 using the formula

```
        b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)
x = – ----------------------
               2a
```

Have the program prompt for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, then print both values of `x`. (If b^2 - 4ac is negative, the program should instead print a message to the effect that the roots are complex.)
