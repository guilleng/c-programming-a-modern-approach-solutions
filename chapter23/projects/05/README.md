# Chapter 23 - Project 05

Suppose that money is deposited into a savings account and left for _t_ years. Assume that the annual interest rate is _r_ and that interest is compounded continuously. The formula _A(t) = P*e^(rt)_ can be used to calculate the final value of the account, where _P_ is the original amount deposited. For example, $1000 left on deposit for 10 years at 6% interest would be worth _$1000 × e^(.06×10) = $1000 × e^(.6) = $1000 × 1.8221188 = $1,822.12_. Write a program that displays the result of this calculation after prompting the user to enter the original amount deposited, the interest rate, and the number of years.
