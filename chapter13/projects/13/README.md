# Chapter 13 - Project 13

Modify Programming Project 15 from Chapter 8 so that it includes the following function:  

```
void encrypt(char *message, int shift);
```

The function expects message to point to a string containing the message to be encrypted; shift represents the amount by which each letter in the message is to be shifted.
