## Rationale

Track and document personal progress while working through the book "C
Programming a Modern Approach" by K. N. King.  Also as an opportunity to get
familiar with version control basic usage and may serve as a reference for other
learners who are using the same study material. 


## Environment
 
Source code is compiled and tested with:
```
gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0

## Layout

The repository is organized into chapters, each with a separate folder.
Within each chapter folder, there are two subdirectories: one for the
`/exercises` and one for the programming `/projects`.

Each book exercise has its own numbered folder within the `/exercises`
subdirectory, containing a README file with a full transcription and its
solution, as well as any source code needed to complete it.

Each project has its own numbered folder within the projects subdirectory,
containing a README file with a full transcription of the project prompt and all
the necessary source code files for completing the project.
