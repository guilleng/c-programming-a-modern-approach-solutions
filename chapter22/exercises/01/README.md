# Chapter 22 - Exercise 01

Indicate whether each of the following files is more likely to contain text data or binary data:

(a) A file of object code produced by a C compiler  
(b) A program listing produced by a C compiler  
(c) An email message sent from one computer to another  
(d) A file containing a graphics image   

---


(a) This file is more likely to contain binary data. Object code files are the compiled output of source code, consisting of machine code and other binary data specific to the target platform.

(b) This file is more likely to contain text data. A program listing is typically a human-readable representation of the source code, which includes comments, variable names, and other textual information.

(c) This file is more likely to contain text data. Email messages are predominantly composed of textual content, including the sender, recipient, subject, and message body. While email attachments can be binary files, the email itself is generally composed of text.

(d) This file is more likely to contain binary data. Graphics images are typically stored in binary formats that represent pixel data, color information, compression, etc.
