# Chapter 22 - Exercise 11

The following loop appears in the `fcopy.c` program:  

```
while ((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);
```

Suppose that we neglected to put parentheses around `ch = getc(source_fp)`:  

```
while (ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);
```

Would the program compile without an error? If so, what would the program do when itâ€™s run?

---

The program will compile without errors. To analyze its behavior, let's add some parentheses according to the operator precedence rules:  

```
while (ch = (getc(source_fp) != EOF))
    putc(ch, dest_fp);
```

The expression `ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF` is evaluated in accordance with the operator precedence rules. The result will be either true (1) or false (0), depending on whether the character retrieved from `source_fp` is equal to `EOF`.  

If `ch` is assigned the value `1`, The loop evaluate its condition and write the character `SOC` (Start of Heading) to the file.  

In conclusion, the program will write the value 1 repeatedly to the `dest_fp` file. If `source_fp` does not contain an `EOF` character, the loop will execute indefinitely.
