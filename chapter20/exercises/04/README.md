# Chapter 20 - Exercise 04

In computer graphics, colors are often stored as three numbers, representing red, green, and blue intensities. Suppose that each number requires eight bits, and weâ€™d like to store all three values in a single long integer. Write a macro named `MK_COLOR` with three parameters (the red, green, and blue intensities). `MK_COLOR` should return a `long` in which the last three bytes contain the red, green, and blue intensities, with the red value as the last byte and the green value as the next-to-last byte.

---

Assuming the values `r`, `g` and `b` displayed below, and only showing the significant bytes of our expected result, it is observable:  

```
r = 0x81;     /* 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 0001 */
g = 0xC3;     /* 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100 0011 */
b = 0xE7;     /* 0000 0000 0000 0000 1110 0111 */

g <<= 8;      /* 0000 0000 1100 0011 0000 0000 */
b <<= 16;     /* 1110 0111 0000 0000 0000 0000 */

rgb = r | g | b;  /* 1110 0111 1100 0011 1000 0001 */
```

Condensing the declarations into one statement: 

```
#define MK_COLOR(r,g,b)  (((b) << 16) | ((g) << 8) | (r))
```
