# Chapter 17 - Exercise 13

The following function is supposed to insert a new node into its proper place in an ordered list, returning a pointer to the first node in the modified list. Unfortunately, the function doesn't work correctly in all cases. Explain whatâ€™s wrong with it and show how to fix it. Assume that the `node` structure is the one defined in Section 17.5.  

```
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list,
struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while (cur->value <= new_node->value)
    {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;
    return list;
}
```
---

If the list is empty, the expression `cur->value` in the loop condition dereferences a `NULL` pointer which causes undefined behavior.  
If the value to insert goes last in a non empty list, the same behavior as above is exhibited. i.e.: List is `1 2 3` and `new_node->value = 10`.  
If the value to insert goes first in a non empty list list, the expression `prev->next` dereferences a `NULL` pointer. i.e.: List is `1 2 3` and `new_node->value = 0`  

```
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;

    if (!cur)
    {
        /* empty list */
        list = new_node;
        new_node->next = prev;
        return list;
    }
    else if (cur->value >= new_node->value)
    {
        /* insert at head */
        new_node->next = list;
        list = new_node;
        return list;
    }
    while (cur)
    {
        /* insert between two existing nodes or at tail */
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
        if(cur && new_node->value <= cur->value) 
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;

    return list;
}
```
