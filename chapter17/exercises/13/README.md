# Chapter 17 - Exercise 13

The following function is supposed to insert a new node into its proper place in
an ordered list, returning a pointer to the first node in the modified list.
Unfortunately, the function doesn't work correctly in all cases.  Explain whatâ€™s
wrong with it and show how to fix it.  Assume that the `node` structure is the
one defined in Section 17.5.

```C
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while (cur->value <= new_node->value)
    {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;
    return list;
}
```

---

If the list is empty, the expression `cur->value` in the loop condition
dereferences a `NULL` pointer which causes undefined behavior.

If the value to insert is greater than all values in a non-empty list, the same
behavior as mentioned above is exhibited.  For example, if the list is `1 2 3`
and `new_node->value = 10`, the loop will continue until it reaches the end of
the list, resulting in `cur` being a `NULL` pointer.

If the value to insert is smaller than all values in a non-empty list, the
expression `prev->next` dereferences a `NULL` pointer.  For instance, if the
list is `1 2 3` and `new_node->value = 0`, the loop will not execute, and `prev`
will be `NULL`.  Thus, the assignment `prev->next = new_node` will dereference a
`NULL` pointer.


```C
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;

    if (cur == NULL)
    {
        /* empty list */
        list = new_node;
        new_node->next = prev;
        return list;
    }
    else if (cur->value >= new_node->value)
    {
        /* insert at head */
        new_node->next = list;
        list = new_node;
        return list;
    }
    while (cur)
    {
        /* insert between two existing nodes or at tail */
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
        if(cur && new_node->value <= cur->value) 
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;

    return list;
}
```
